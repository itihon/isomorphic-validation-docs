A single `Validation` object contains only one predicate group associated with the bound validatable object. Its validity state depends on results of executing the predicates.

We can connect UI effects to changes of the validity state of a `Validation` object and changes of execution results of its predicates by adding [`state callbacks`](/concept/state-callbacks).
