### `Validation` as a state callback

Since `Validation` objects are callable and, while executing on the client side, they are [`event handler`](/api/validation/callable-object/event-handler/) functions, it is possible to chain their execution by adding them as [`state callbacks`](/concept/state-callbacks/) and run conditionally: one depending on the state of another.

```js
const validation1 = Validation();
const validation2 = Validation();
// validation2 will run when validation1 becomes "invalid"
validation1.invalid(validation2);
```

Or unconditionally (sequentially), just one after another:

```js
const validation1 = Validation();
const validation2 = Validation();
// validation2 will run after validation1
validation1.validated(validation2);
```

So when `validation1` gets validated the code snippets above are roughly equivalient to this:

```js
const validation1 = Validation();
const validation2 = Validation();

// conditional execution
validation1.validate().then((res1) => {
    if (!res1.isValid) {
        validation2.validate(); 
    }
    return res1;
});

// unconditional execution
validation1.validate().then((res1) => {
    validation2.validate(); 
    return res1;
});
```

The result of `validation2` is not "awaited" and does not affect the result of `validation1`.

:::note
    This pattern will not work on the server side because of `Validation` object being a [middleware](/api/validation/callable-object/middleware/) function. If you need to implement such logic on the server side you will have to wrap a `Validation` into an arrow function and call the [`Validation().validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/) method explicitly:
```js
const validation1 = Validation();
const validation2 = Validation();
validation1.invalid(() => validation2.validate());
```
:::

#### Example

In this example one `Validation` object is added as ["invalid"](/api/validation/instance-methods/invalid/) state callback of another one. Initially, the input field is painted gray. Try to input letter characters, it turns green. Then type in something other than letters, it turns red. Eventually, if you decide to clear it out, it returns back to its initial state and becomes gray.

<Playground client:visible  
    params={{
        console: 'closed',
        js: stateCallbackExampleJS,
        html: stateCallbackExampleHTML,
    }}
    height="500px"
    width="100%"
/>

Depending on your code style you could write the above validation logic like this:

<Code code={stateCallbackExample2JS} lang='js' />

If you wrote it in "vanilla" javascript it might have looked like this:

```js
textField.addEventListener(
    'input',
    function(e) {
        const { value } = e.target;

        if (isOnlyLetters(value)) {
            paintFieldGreen();
        }
        else {
            if (isInitValue(value)) {
                paintFieldGray();
            }
            else {
                paintFieldRed();
            }
        }
    }
);
```

### Chaining validations of different validatable objects

A state callback function accepts a [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result/) object which has the `target` property. A `Validation` object, when used as an [`event handler`](/api/validation/callable-object/event-handler/) on the client side, accepts an `Event` object which also has the `target` property. So it is possible to chain `Validation` objects bound to the same validatable object. 

```js
const validation1 = Validation(element1);
const validation2 = Validation(element1);
const validation3 = Validation(element1);

// validation2({ target: element1 }) // works
validation1.invalid(validation2); 

// validation3({ target: element1 }) // works
validation2.invalid(validation3); 

// validation1({ target: element1 }) // works
element1.addEventListener('input', validation1); 
```

:::note
If a chained `Validation` object is bound to a different validatable object than that which is passed to it as the property `target` when called as a callable object on the client side, then no predicate groups of the chained validation object will be executed. See "Description" of the [`Validation().validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/#description) method.

```js
const validation1 = Validation(element1);
const validation2 = Validation(element1);
const validation3 = Validation(element2);

// validation2({ target: element1 }) // works
validation1.invalid(validation2); 

// validation3({ target: element1 }) // warning
validation2.invalid(validation3);    // validation3 doesn't have predicate groups associated with element1

// validation1({ target: element1 }) // works
element1.addEventListener('input', validation1); 
```
:::

If you need to chain validations bound to different validatable objects you can wrap a `Validation` into an arrow function to isolate from the passed in argument:
> `validation2.invalid(() => validation3());`

Also the safest way (but rather verbose) and compatible with both client and server side is to call the `.validate()` method explicitly and pass no arguments in case of a ["single"](/concept/single-validation/) `Validation`. See "Description" of the [`Validation.validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/#description) method.

```js
const validation1 = Validation(element1);
const validation2 = Validation(element1);
const validation3 = Validation(element2);

validation1.invalid(() => validation2.validate()); // works
validation2.invalid(() => validation3.validate()); // works

element1.addEventListener('input', validation1); 
```

#### Example

In this example there are three chains of validations:

<details>
    <summary>
        `ageV` --> `careerYearsV` --> `experienceV` --> `initValueV`
    </summary>
`formV({ target: age })` --> `ageV.validated(careerYearsV)` --> `careerYearsV.validated(() => experienceV())` --> `experienceV.validated(initValueV)` --> `initValueV({ target: experience })`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        `ageV` --> `initValueV`
    </summary>
`formV({ target: age })` --> `ageV.validated(initValueV)` --> `initValueV({ target: age })`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        `experienceV` --> `initValueV`
    </summary>
`formV({ target: experience })` --> `experienceV.validated(initValueV)` --> `initValueV({ target: experience })`
</details>

The third chain is a part of the first one because validity of data in the experience field depends on data in the age field that is possible experience can not be greater than the entered age minus the start career age which is 21 in this example. Therefore, the experience field needs to be revalidated every time data in the age field changes.

:::note 
In this example `isPossibleExperience` predicate function accepts the experience field value as the only argument and directly addresses the age field value which in this particular case is safe because all predicate functions here are synchronous. In case of asynchronous predicate functions (especially if the same validation logic is performed on the server side) a better solution would be to make `isPossibleExperience` accept both values as arguments by adding it as a constraint to "glued" validations.

See the same example but with ["glued"](/api/validation/static-methods/glue/#validating-one-field-depending-on-another) validations.

Also see the description of the [`Validation().validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/#description) method for details.
:::

Validity of data in the fields are checked with `ageV` and `experienceV` validations which are grouped into `formV` that serves as the entry point of the form validation process and controls access to the submit button. `initValueV` is used to paint the fields gray when they are empty. The experience field gets enabled with `careerYearsV` and `experienceV` gets revalidated with it. Since `careerYearsV` and `experienceV` are bound to different fields the latter is wrapped into an arrow function when added as ["validated"](/api/validation/instance-methods/validated/) state callback of the former.

<Playground client:visible  
    params={{
        console: 'closed',
        js: chainingDiffObjExampleJS,
        html: chainingDiffObjExampleHTML,
    }}
    height="500px"
    width="100%"
/>

It might look irrational to validate data against field constraints first and after all validations perform the initial value check. But if we put `initValueV` first and then will be performing the rest validations **unconditionally**, the fields will never paint gray when they are empty. So the order of the validations in the chains makes sense.  

:::caution 
Performing actual form data validation should not depend on other validations introduced for side effects. It should either precede in a chain or be performed **unconditionally**.
:::

The next example below shows how the validation chains could have been recomposed and the problem it entails.

### Chaining grouping validations

If you need to conditionally validate a particular predicate group of a ["grouping"](/concept/grouping-validations/) `Validation`, pass the validatable object it associated with to the `.validate()` method. See "Description" of the [`Validation.validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/#description) method.

```js
const validation1 = Validation(element1);
const validation2 = Validation(element1);
const validation3 = Validation(element2);
const validationGr23 = Validation.group(validation2, validation3);

// runs predicates added to validation2
validation1.invalid(validationGr23); // validationGr23({ target: element1 }) 
validation1.invalid(() => validationGr23.validate(element1)); 
validation1.invalid(() => validationGr23({ target: element1 })); 

// runs predicates added to validation3
validation1.invalid(() => validationGr23.validate(element2));
validation1.invalid(() => validationGr23({ target: element2 }));

element1.addEventListener('input', validation1); 
```

Let's recompose the validation chains from the previous example.

<details>
    <summary>
        `initValueV` --> `ageV` --> `careerYearsV` --> `initValueV` --> `experienceV`
    </summary>
`initValueV({ target: age })` --> `initValueV.validations[0].invalid(formV)` --> `ageV.validated(careerYearsV)` --> `careerYearsV.validated(() => initValue.validate(experience))` --> `initValueV.validations[1].invalid(formV)` --> `experienceV()`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        `initValueV` --> `experienceV`
    </summary>
`initValueV({ target: experience })` --> `initValueV.validations[1].invalid(formV)` --> `experienceV()`
</details>

Now `initValueV` serves as the entry point of the form validation process and starts validating a field against its constraints if the field is not empty. The second chain is a part of the first one because the experience field still needs to be revalidated when the age field changes. And since `initValueV` is a grouping validation, when added as ["validated"](/api/validation/instance-methods/validated/) state callback of `careerYearsV`, it gets the experience field as the target object to perform check only on this field leaving out the age field (It is already being checked! If you omit that passed in target object, checks on both fields will be executed and you will get an **infinite loop**). Next, the passed in object is getting passed further along to `formV` to validate only the experience field against its constraints.

<Playground client:visible  
    params={{
        console: 'closed',
        js: chainingDiffObjExample2JS,
        html: chainingDiffObjExample2HTML,
    }}
    height="500px"
    width="100%"
/>

Although the order of validations now may look more sound, the **problem** with this example after recomposing the chains is that now actual form data validation `formV` depends on the validation `initValueV` which is performed merely for the sake of side effects. Now after transition from "invalid" to empty state the experience field remains "invalid" (though it should be "valid", it is optional) and the submit button doesn't get enabled. The opposite true for the age field. This is because `formV` is performed **conditionally**.
