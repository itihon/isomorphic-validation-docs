## Validation

A `Validation` object can be created several ways:
    - A [single](/concept/single-validation) `Validation` is created by the [constructor](/api/validation/constructor) function.
    - A [grouping](/concept/grouping-validations) `Validation` is created by the static methods [`Validation.group`](/api/validation/static-methods/group) and [`Validation.glue`](/api/validation/static-methods/glue)
    - Also a [grouping](/concept/grouping-validations) `Validation` with nested (grouped), bound to form fields `Validation` objects is created by the [`Validation.profile`](/api/validation/static-methods/profile) static method.
    - And lastly, a [single](/concept/single-validation) `Validation` is created by the [`Validation.clone`](/api/validation/static-methods/clone) method from another [single](/concept/single-validation) `Validation`.
