## Playground

:::tip
  For convenience, you can open this playground in a separate tab by clicking on this icon <img width={'32px'} height={'32px'} style={{ display: 'inline' }} src="/livecodes-v35/livecodes/assets/images/livecodes-logo.svg"></img>, detach that tab as a separate window, and watch the video in one window and play with the code in the playground in another.
:::

<Playground client:visible  
  params={{
    console: 'closed',
    js: quickIntroductionJS,
    html: quickIntroductionHTML,
    css: quickIntroductionCSS,
  }}

## Key ideas

UI side effects can be connected with state callbacks to:
  - single `Validation` states;
  - group states;
  - and also `Predicate` states.

Effect function can have: 
  - different effect values to be applied for each validity state;
  - different delays to be applied for each validity state;
  - the target (event target by default) to which the effect is applied and which can be overriden;
  - a delay which can be cancelled by a later applied effect with the same effect ID.
