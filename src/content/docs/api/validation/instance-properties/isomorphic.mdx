The `Validation().isomorphic` property "marks" all the methods invokations following after it as being invoked on both, client and server sides.

## Value

The `Validation` object.

## Description

The purpose of this property is to provide a way for a `Validation` object to switch back to the "isomorphic" mode (in which it was by default) after using the [`Validation().client`](/api/validation/instance-properties/client/) or the [`Validation().server`](/api/validation/instance-properties/server/) property.
