The `Validation().constraints` property returns a `Map` with [validatable objects](/api/validation/constructor/#parameters) as keys and sets of predicate groups associated with them as values.

## Value

A `Map` object.

## Description

The main purpose of this property is to access constraints added with the [`Validation().constraint()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/constraint/) method in order to get their current validity state (the property `isValid`), address additional data that were supplied with them as `anyData` or add [state callbacks](/concept/state-callbacks/) to them.

For the reason that several validations can be bound to one validatable object and then [grouped](/concept/grouping-validations/) into one `Validation`, this `Map` contains sets of arrays of "validators" as values. The standard `Map` iterator and the `forEach` method are overridden for convinience, so that they iterate over validatable objects as keys and "validators" as values.

These "validator" objects "inherit" all properties and methods of [`Predicate()`](/api/predicate/constructor/), have the property `isValid` representing their current validity state and are populated with the `anyData`.

## Examples

### Iterator, accessing the `anyData` and the property `isValid`

<Code code={iteratorExample} lang='js' mark={['.constraints', '...', 'isValid', 'msg' ]}/>

### Method `forEach`, adding state callbacks to "validators"

<Code code={foreachExample} lang='js' mark={['.constraints', '.forEach', 'isValid', 'msg' ]}/>

### JSON representation

<Code code={jsonExample} lang='js' mark={['.constraints', 'isValid', 'msg' ]}/>
