This page will be avalable soon. It is not created apparently because I haven't had time and **YOU** haven't contributed it yet.

Also, instead of passing an array into the `.group()` method you can use the `Validation().validations` property:

```js
const initValueV = Validation.group(
    Validation.group(
        Validation(age), Validation(experience)
    )
    .constraint(isInitValue)
    .validations.map(
        validation => validation
            .valid(paintFieldGray)      // paint a field gray if it is empty
            .invalid(formV)             // otherwise validate against field constraints
    )
);
```
