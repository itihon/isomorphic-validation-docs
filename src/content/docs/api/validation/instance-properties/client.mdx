The `Validation().client` property "marks" all the methods invokations following after it as being invoked on the client side only and ignored on the server side.

## Value

The `Validation` object.

## Description

The purpose of this property is to provide a way of [adding constraints](/api/validation/instance-methods/constraint) and [state callbacks](/concept/state-callbacks) to a `Validation` object separately for the client and server side.

## Examples

See ["Execution environment separation"](/concept/execution-environment-separation).
