import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import validateExample from '../../../../../../public/playground/api/validation/instance-methods/validate/validate.js?raw';

Validates a [`validatableObject`](/api/validation/constructor#parameters) of the `Validation` against constraints added by the [`Validation().constraint()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/constraint) method. Runs [state callbacks](/concept/state-callbacks).

## Syntax

```js
Validation().validate()
Validation().validate(validatableObject)
```

### Parameters

- `validatableObject` <sup>optional</sup>
<br/> An object to which a `Validation` is bound during [creation time](/api/validation/constructor#parameters) or via the [`Validation().bind()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/bind) method.
<br/> **Default**: `undefined`.

### Return value

A `Promise` that fufills/rejects depending on the success/fail of the operation: 

- In case of successful execution of the method the `Promise` will be fulfilled with a [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object no matter valid or invalid. 

- If the `Validation` object does not contain predicate groups associated with the `validatableObject` passed in, the `Promise` will be rejected with the error message.

- If an `async` predicate function returns a `Promise` that fulfills with any value other than `Boolean`, the `Promise` returned by this method will be rejected with the error message.

- If an error occurs in an `async` predicate function, the `Promise` will be rejected with the error message.

### Exceptions

Any synchronous error that occurs in a predicate function or a [state callback](/concept/state-callbacks) will be thrown synchronously unless an [error state callback](/concept/error-handling) was added, in this case the error will be catched.

## Description

For a [grouping](/concept/grouping-validations) `Validation`, when a `validatableObject` is passed in only the predicate group associated with this object will be executed. When nothing is passed in all predicate groups will be executed. For a [single](/concept/single-validation) `Validation`, it doesn't matter whether that object is passed or not, since it contains only one predicate group.

This method is performed under the hood when a `Validation` object is used as a [middleware](/api/validation/callable-object/middleware) and [event handler](/api/validation/callable-object/event-handler).

## Examples

This example demonstrates the logic described above.
