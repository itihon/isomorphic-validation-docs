Adds state callbacks which will be invoked before predicates execution.

## Syntax

```js
Validation().started(callback1, callback2, /* ..., */ callbackN)
```

### Parameters

- `callback1, ..., callbackN`
<br/> Functions to add. If anything other than a function is passed in it will be ignored and no error thrown. The callback functions will be called with the following arguments:

    - `validationResult` 
    <br/> A [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object. 

### Return value

The `Validation` object. 

## Description

Adds state callbacks to the `Validation` object. Once the `Validation` in the specified state, the corresponding callbacks will be invoked one by one in the order they were added. The main purpose of state callbacks is to perform side effects related to the state. A [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object is passed into state callbacks.

:::note
The property `isValid` of the [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object that is passed into "started" state callbacks is the result of the previous call of the ['Validation().validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate) method.
