Adds state callbacks which will be invoked every time the state of the `Validation` changes from "valid" to "invalid" and backwards. For a ["grouping"](/concept/grouping-validations) `Validation`, since its state depends on the grouped (nested) `Validation` objects, these callbacks will run even without invoking the [`Validation().validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate) method on it directly.

## Syntax

```js
Validation().changed(callback1, callback2, /* ..., */ callbackN)
```

### Parameters

- `callback1, ..., callbackN`
<br/> Functions to add. The callback functions will be called with the following arguments:

    - `validationResult` 
    <br/> A [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object. 

### Return value

The `Validation` object. 

### Exceptions

If anything other than a function is passed in the corresponding error will be thrown. 

## Description

Adds state callbacks to the `Validation` object. Once the `Validation` in the specified state, the corresponding callbacks will be invoked one by one in the order they were added. The main purpose of state callbacks is to perform side effects related to the state. A [`ValidationResult`](/api/validation-result) object is passed into state callbacks.
