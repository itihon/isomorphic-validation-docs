Groups `Validation` objects into one.

## Syntax

```js
Validation.group(validation1, validation2, /* ..., */ validationN)
Validation.group([validation1, validation2, /* ..., */ validationN])
Validation.group([validation1, validation2], /* ..., */ validationN)
Validation.group(validation1, [validation2, /* ..., */ validationN])
Validation.group([[validation1, validation2], /* ..., */ validationN])
Validation.group(validation1, [[validation2], /* ..., */ validationN])
Validation.group(validation1, [validation2], /* ..., */ [validationN])
```

### Parameters

- `validation1, ..., validationN`
<br/> A `Validation` object. 

### Return value

A new grouping `Validation` object. 

### Exceptions

If not a `Validation` was passed in or an `Array` that contains not a `Validation`, throws the corresponding error.

## Description

Accepts `Validation` objects or arrays of `Validation` objects of any nesting level or both in any combination. The `Validation` objects passed in can be [single](/concept/single-validation) as well as other [grouping](/concept/grouping-validations) `Validation` objects. Repetitive `Validation` objects will be ignored, only the unique ones will be grouped. The returned grouping `Validation` object "subscribes" to state changes of the grouped `Validation` objects and its validity state depends on them.

## Examples

Here `validation1` and `validation2` are grouped into `validationGr` and have the same set of predicate functions. First `isGreaterOrEqual(1)` and `isGreaterOrEqual(2)` are added to them respectively, then `isNaturalNumber` is added to them both through the grouping validation `validationGr`. See how a particular predicate group can be validated by passing its associated object into the [`Validation.validate()`](/api/validation/instance-methods/validate) method. When both `validation1` and `validation2` are in "valid" state, `validationGr` also changes its state to "valid" even though not having been validated directly.
