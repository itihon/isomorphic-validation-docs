The `Predicate().isomorphic` property "marks" all the methods invokations following after it as being invoked on both, client and server sides.

## Value

The `Predicate` object.

## Description

The purpose of this property is to provide a way for a `Predicate` object to switch back to the "isomorphic" mode (in which it was by default) after using the [`Predicate().client`](/api/predicate/instance-properties/client/) or the [`Predicate().server`](/api/predicate/instance-properties/server/) property.
