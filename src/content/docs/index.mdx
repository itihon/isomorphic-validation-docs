## Features

<CardGrid stagger>

	<Card title="Uniform way of writing validation logic" icon="seti:todo">
		Allows to maintain one source of truth for both client and server side. 
	</Card>

	<Card title="Grouping and cloning" icon="seti:svg">
		Don't repeat yourself. Write repetitive validation steps for fields of different forms for both client and server side once in one place. Allows to write validation logic of any complexity.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Straightforward API" icon="seti:happenings">
		No need to search through a lot of method names, string constants, config options. Just think of what checks should be performed, where, and with what side effects.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Interactivity" icon="random">
		Make user input highly interactive with little effort by connecting UI side effects to validity states.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Any validation strategy" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Allows to implement any validation strategy: on focus out, on submit, on input. You can even make requests and perform all validations on the server side.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Functional style" icon="seti:haskell">
		Suits for those who think everything should be a function.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Good for educational purposes" icon="pen">
		Eases cognitive load from using different solutions for the client and server side. Abstracts away common boilerplate code and necessary but easy-to-forget operations. 
	</Card>
