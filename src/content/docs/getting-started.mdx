import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Installation

The library contains both ESM and CJS uncompressed modules. Depending on your project setup, you may need to configure a module bundler.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
        ```bash
            npm install isomorphic-validation
        ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash
            pnpm install isomorphic-validation
        ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="yarn">
        ```bash
            yarn install isomorphic-validation
        ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="CDN">
        For browser only usage, you can pull the library using CDN like [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/isomorphic-validation) or [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).

</Tabs>

## Usage

<Steps>
1. Define predicate functions or import from another library.

2. Create validation objects.

3. Add predicates as common constraints to the validations.

    - Group validations if needed to add constraints shared between validations.

    - Separate environment specific constraints if needed.

4. Connect common side effects to predicates and validations validity states.

    - Separate side effects by environments if needed.

5. Create profiles (bind the validations to form fields)

6. Add form specific constraints and side effects to cloned validations if needed.

7. Add grouping validations as event handlers and middlewares.

8. Don't forget about error handling.
